        <h2><i><u>What is basketball?</u></i></h2>
        <p> <i><b>What is basketball? Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court,<br>
            usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal hoop<br>
            and net called a basket.</b></i></p>

         <h2><i><u>Where Basketball originated?</u></i></h2>
        <p> <i><b>It was the winter of 1891-1892. Inside a gymnasium at Springfield College (then known as the International YMCA Training School),<br>
            located in Springfield, Mass., was a group of restless college students. The young men had to be there; they were required to participate <br>
            in indoor activities to burn off the energy that had been building up since their football season ended. The gymnasium class offered them <br>
            activities such as marching, calisthenics, <br>
            and apparatus work, but these were pale substitutes for the more exciting games of football and lacrosse they played in warmer seasons.</b></i></p>


        <h2><i><u>James Naismith, The Person Who Invented Basketball</u></i></h2>
        <p> <i><b>The instructor of this class was James Naismith, a 31-year-old graduate student.<br>
            After graduating from Presbyterian College in Montreal with a theology degree, Naismith<br>
            embraced his love of athletics and headed to Springfield to study physical education—at<br>
            that time, a relatively new and unknown academic discipline—under Luther Halsey Gulick,<br>
            superintendent of physical education at the College and today renowned as the father of<br>


            physical education and recreation in the United States.<br>
            As Naismith, a second-year graduate student who had been named to the teaching faculty, looked<br>
            at his class, his mind flashed to the summer session of 1891, when Gulick introduced<br>
            a new course in the psychology of play. In class discussions, Gulick had stressed the<br>
            need for a new indoor game, one “that would be interesting, easy to learn, and easy<br>
            to play in the winter and by artificial light.” No one in the class had followed up<br>
            on Gulick’s challenge to invent such a game. But now, faced with the end of the fall<br>
            sports season and students dreading the mandatory and dull required gymnasium work, Naismith had a new motivation.<br>
            Two instructors had already tried and failed to devise activities that would interest the young<br>
            men. The faculty had met to discuss what was becoming a persistent problem with the<br>
            class’s unbridled energy and disinterest in required work.<br>


            During the meeting, Naismith later wrote that he had expressed his opinion that “the trouble is<br>
            not with the men, but with the system that we are using.” He felt that the kind of<br>
            work needed to motivate and inspire the young men he faced “should be of a recreative nature, something that would appeal to their play instincts.”<br>
            Before the end of the faculty meeting, Gulick placed the problem squarely in Naismith’s lap.<br>
            “Naismith,” he said. “I want you to take that class and see what you can do with it.”<br>
            So Naismith went to work. His charge was to create a game that was easy to assimilate,<br>
            yet complex enough to be interesting. It had to be playable indoors or on any kind of<br>
            ground, and by a large number of players all at once. It should provide plenty of exercise,<br>
            yet without the roughness of football, soccer, or rugby since those would threaten bruises and broken bones if played in a confined space.<br>
            Much time and thought went into this new creation. It became an adaptation of many games of its time,<br>
            including American rugby (passing), English rugby (the jump ball), lacrosse (use of a goal),<br>


            soccer (the shape and size of the ball), and something called duck on a rock, a game Naismith<br>
            had played with his childhood friends in Bennie’s Corners, Ontario. Duck on a rock used a ball<br>
            and a goal that could not be rushed. The goal could not be slammed through, thus necessitating<br>
            “a goal with a horizontal opening high enough so that the ball would have to be tossed into it, rather than being thrown.”<br>
            Naismith approached the school janitor, hoping he could find two, 18-inch square boxes to use as goals.<br>
            The janitor came back with two peach baskets instead. Naismith then nailed them to the lower<br>
            rail of the gymnasium balcony, one at each end. The height of that lower balcony rail happened<br>
            to be ten feet. A man was stationed at each end of the balcony to pick the ball from the basket<br>
            and put it back into play. It wasn’t until a few years later that the bottoms of those peach baskets were cut to let the ball fall loose.<br>
            Naismith then drew up the 13 original rules, which described, among other facets, the method of moving the<br>
            ball and what constituted a foul. A referee was appointed. The game would be divided into two,<br>
            15-minute halves with a five-minute resting period in between. Naismith’s secretary typed up<br>
            the rules and tacked them on the bulletin board. A short time later, the gym class met, and<br>
            the teams were chosen with three centers, three forwards, and three guards per side. Two of<br>
            the centers met at mid-court, Naismith tossed the ball, and the game of “basket ball” was born.</b></i></p>
